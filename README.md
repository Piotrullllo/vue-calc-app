# About
This is a basic calculator app, that I've created using Vue framework as an exsercise.

# Keyboard shortcuts:
There are few key shortcuts, that allow to use the app using keyboard:
- Numpad0-9 - types in a digit,
- NumpadDecimal - adds decimal point,
- Enter - works as equal button,
- Numpad operand keys - choose the calculation operation (eg. addition, subtraction),
- Digit5 - a percent button (divides by 100),
- Digit6 - squares the number,
- Digit7 - square-roots the number,
- Backspace - deletes last digit,
- Delete - works as C button,
- ESC - works as AC button,
- Tilde key - makes number either negative or positive,
- M - recovers data from calculator's memory,
- Minor key (<) - substracts displayed number from memorised number,
- Major key (>) - adds displayed number to memorised number,
